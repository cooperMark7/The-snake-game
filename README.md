# The-snake-game-
This project creates a Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The snake moves on a grid, eats food to grow, and avoids walls and itself. HTML sets up the grid, CSS styles it, and JavaScript handles movement, collision detection, and scoring. Features include a game over screen with restart options.

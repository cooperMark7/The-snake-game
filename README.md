## Game Rules
The player controls a snake that moves around the screen.
The goal of the game is to make the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or its own tail.
The snake grows in size as it eats food, which is randomly generated on the game board.
The player loses the game if the snake runs into a wall or its own tail.
The game may include bonuses or power-ups that can be collected to increase the player's score or give the snake temporary invincibility.
The game may include different levels, with increasing difficulty as the snake grows.
The game may include a high score system that saves the highest scores.

CSS: Styles the game elements and provides visual feedback.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, food generation, and game state management.
Code Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the game structure.
